(To understand the relationships among various columns in your dataset and select independent variables, target variables, and irrelevant features, you can use various visualization libraries. One of the most commonly used libraries for this purpose is Seaborn, which is built on top of Matplotlib and provides more aesthetically pleasing and informative visualizations. Here are some Seaborn plots you can use for exploratory data analysis:)

1. **Pair Plot**: To visualize pairwise relationships among multiple variables.

2. **line Plot**: also known as a line chart or time series plot, is used to visualize the relationship between two continuous variables over time or another continuous dimension.

3. **Histogram**: To visualize the distribution of a single numeric variable.
